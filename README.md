Project Overview

Data scientists can securely upload and retrieve ML models via AWS Lambda (and optionally API Gateway), while compliance teams have read-only access with full audit logging powered by AWS CloudTrail.

Built with Terraform (Infrastructure as Code) and Python automation, this project demonstrates best practices in cloud security, role-based access control, DevOps automation, and ML platform governance.

🛠️ Project Flow
	1.	User Access & Authentication
	•	Users (Data Scientists and Compliance) authenticate via IAM roles or AWS Cognito.
	•	Permissions are enforced based on team roles.
	2.	Model Artifact Operations
	•	Uploads trigger Lambda functions via API Gateway.
	•	Downloads are securely authorized and served, optionally via presigned URLs.
	3.	Secure Storage
	•	Models stored in encrypted, versioned S3 buckets with strict bucket policies.
	4.	Access Control & Auditing
	•	All access logged via CloudTrail and S3 Access Logs.
	•	Compliance team reviews logs for governance.
	5.	Monitoring & Alerts
	•	CloudWatch monitors service health and security events.
	•	Alerts can be configured for suspicious activity.
	6.	Data Delivery
	•	Authorized artifacts delivered securely to users.
